# Running the Toy Problems code challenge using Node.js

This guide explains how to run the JavaScript files used to solve the Toy Problems Week 1 Code Challenge using Node.js after cloning a project from GitHub. The Code Challenge aimed at;

1. Generating student's grade based on the score entered by a user
2. Getting a salary input from the user and calculating the net salary of a Kenyan employee after tax deductions
3. Getting a car's speed as the input and checking whether the speed provided is above the speed limit. If it's above the speed limit, the program should calculate and output the demerit points the driver has accumulated.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisite installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): Download and install Node.js from the official website.

## Getting started

### Clone the GitHub Repository

**Clone the repository:** 

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project. Then, run the following command to clone the GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NdunguSam01/toy-problems-week-1.git
```

**Navigate to the project directory:** Change your working directory to the newly cloned project folder:
```bash
cd toy-problems-week-1
```

**Locate the JavaScript file:** 

In the cloned project directory, locate the JavaScript file you want to run. The file will have a .js extension

**Run the JavaScript file:** 

To do this, type the following command to run your JavaScript file using Node.js:
```bash
node fileName.js
```
Replace the fileName with the exact file name. In this case, we will be running three different files for the different solutions. So the commands for the three files names will be
```bash
node Grade-generator.js
```
```bash
node Speed-detector.js
```
```bash
node Net-Salary-Calculator.js
```

**Output:** 

To view the output, Node.js will run the code and the output will be visible in the terminal.
