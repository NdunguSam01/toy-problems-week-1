# Running a JavaScript File Using Node.js

This guide explains how to run a JavaScript file using Node.js after cloning a project from GitHub.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisite installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): Download and install Node.js from the official website.

## Clone the GitHub Repository

1. **Clone the repository:** Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project. Then, run the following command to clone the GitHub repository:

   git clone https://github.com/NdunguSam01/toy-problems-week-1.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory:** Change your working directory to the newly cloned project folder:

    cd toy-problems-week-1
3. **Locate the JavaScript file:** In the cloned project directory, locate the JavaScript file you want to run. The file might have a .js extension

4. **Run the JavaScript file:** To do this, type the following command to run your JavaScript file using Node.js:

    node fileName.js

    Replace the fileName with the exact file name. In this case, we will be running three different files for the different solutions. So the commands for the three files names will be

    node Grade-generator.js
    node Speed-detector.js
    node Net-Salary-Calculator.js
     
5. **Output:** To view the output, Node.js will run the code and the output will be visible in the terminal.
